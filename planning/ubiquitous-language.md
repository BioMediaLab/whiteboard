This document is to capture the ubiquitous language (UL) for the UMaine project. A UL is a language structured around the domain model and used by all team members to connect all the activities of the team with the software. By definition the UL excludes all technical considerations/solutioning and focuses solely on the real world problem being solved.

This glossary is only meant to capture the meaning of the terms in the context of the UMaine software. It is a living document that will be refined over time, as our understanding of the business domain evolves.
